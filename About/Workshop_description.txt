[h1]Yayo's Ammunition Patch[/h1]

Patches Yayo's ammunition sytem to be more interesting and have more significant gameplay impact.

[h2]Notable changes[/h2]
[list]
  [*] Calculates an "effective damage" of a weapon based on it's base damage, armor penetration and accuracy. From this, the mod changes how much each shot costs in ammunition. This means that, as long as mod uses vanilla gun mechanics, it should be compatible. Incompatiblity is mostly in mod doing something special for gun mechanics, thus not having the vanilla parameter from which the "effective damage" is calculated.
      Known unsupported mods:
  [list]
    [*] Epona
  [/list]
  [*] Changes how much ammo is produced (3x more) and ammo stack sizes (4x more) to better fit above changes
  [*] Primitive ammo only uses wood. This is to simplify cost calculation. And using something else made no sense.
  [*] Balance Spacer Special so it's per-unit price is same as other Spacer ammo. For consistency.
  [*] Make ammo require specific research before it can be produced
