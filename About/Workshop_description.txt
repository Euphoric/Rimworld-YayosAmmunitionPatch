[h1]Yayo's Ammunition Patch[/h1]

Patches Yayo's ammunition sytem to be more interesting and have more significant gameplay impact.

[h2]Notable changes[/h2]
[list]
  [*] Calculates an "effective damage" of a weapon based on it's base damage, armor penetration and accuracy. From this, the mod changes how much each shot costs in ammunition. This means that, as long as mod uses vanilla gun mechanics, it should be compatible. Incompatiblity is mostly in mod doing something special for gun mechanics, thus not having the vanilla parameter from which the "effective damage" is calculated.
      Known unsupported mods:
  [list]
    [*] Epona
